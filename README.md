One React boilerplate to rule not them all but at least my own prospect projects :)

This boilerplate includes a basic setup for a React project featuring some of the latest tools and practices:

### Technologies:
React, Redux, Saga, Axios, Reselect, Router, Styled components, Material UI, SASS, Jest, Craco, babel, ESLint and Prettier

It also includes a basic lifecycle setup for a weather app that incorporates a service from https://openweathermap.org/api

Any future tool or technology can be included to expand the base scope of the current boilerplate for practice purposes.
